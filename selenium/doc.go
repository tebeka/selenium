/*
Package selenium provides a client to drive web browser-based automation and
testing.

See the example below for how to get started with this API.

This package can depend on several binaries being available, depending on which
browsers will be used and how. To avoid needing to manage these dependencies,
use a cloud-based browser testing environment, like Sauce Labs, BrowserStack
or similar. Otherwise, use the methods provided by this API to specify the
paths to the dependencies, which will have to be downloaded separately.
