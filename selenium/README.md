## About

This is a [WebDriver][selenium] client for [Go][go]. It supports the
[WebDriver protocol][webdriver] and has been tested with various versions of
[Selenium WebDriver][selenium], Firefox and [Geckodriver][geckodriver], and
Chrome and [ChromeDriver][chromedriver],

`selenium` is currently maintained by Eric Garrido ([@minusnine][minusnine]).

## Installing

Run

    go get -t -d github.com/tebeka/selenium

to fetch the package.

The package requires a working WebDriver installation, which can include recent
versions of a web browser being driven by Selenium WebDriver.

### Downloading Dependencies

We provide a means to download the ChromeDriver binary, the Firefox binary, the
Selenium WebDriver JARs, and the Sauce Connect proxy binary. This is primarily
intended for testing.

    $ cd vendor
    $ go get -d ./...
    $ go run init.go --alsologtostderr
    $ cd ..

Re-run this periodically to get up-to-date versions of these binaries.

## Documentation

The API documentation is at https://godoc.org/github.com/tebeka/selenium. See
[the example](https://github.com/tebeka/selenium/blob/master/example_test.go)
and
[the unit tests](https://github.com/tebeka/selenium/blob/master/remote_test.go)
for better usage information.

## Known Issues

Any issues are usually because the underlying browser automation framework has a
bug or inconsistency. Where possible, we try to cover up these underlying
problems in the client, but sometimes workarounds require higher-level
intervention.

Please feel free to [file an issue][issue] if this client doesn't work as
expected.

[issue]: https://github.com/tebeka/selenium/issues/new

Below are known issues that affect the usage of this API. There are likely
others filed on the respective issue trackers.

### Selenium 2

1.  Selenium 2 does not support versions of Firefox newer than 47.0.2.

### Selenium 3 and Geckodriver

1.  [Geckodriver GetAllCookies does not return the expiration date of the cookie](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/463).
2.  [Selenium 3 NewSession does not implement the W3C-specified parameters](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/2827).
3.  [The Proxy object is misinterpreted](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/490)
    by Geckodriver when passed through by Selenium 3.
4.  [Maximizing the browser window hangs](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/703).
5.  [Geckodriver does not support the Log API](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/284)
    because it
    [hasn't been defined in the spec yet](https://github.com/w3c/webdriver/issues/406).
6.  Firefox via Geckodriver (and also through Selenium)
    [doesn't handle clicking on an element](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/322).
7.  Firefox via Geckodriver doesn't handle sending control characters
    [without appending a terminating null key](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/issues/665).

The Geckodriver team recommends using the newest available Firefox version, as
the integration is actively being developed and is constantly improving.

### Geckodriver (Standalone)

The Geckodriver team are actively iterating on support for the W3C standard and
routinely break the existing API. Support for the newest Geckodriver version
within this API will likely lag for a time after its release; we expect the lag
to only be several days to a small number of weeks.

Using Geckodriver without Selenium usually has the above known issues as well.

### ChromeDriver

1.  Various
    [window-related commands are failing with v62+](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=1918).
2.  GetCookies can
    [return an incorrect expiration date in v62+](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=1949).
3.  DeleteCookie
    [doesn't work in v62+](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=1950).

## Breaking Changes

There are a number of upcoming changes that break backward compatibility in an
effort to improve and adapt the existing API. They are listed here:

### 22 August 2017

The `Version` constant was removed as it is unused.

### 18 April 2017

The Log method was changed to accept a typed constant for the type of log to
retrieve, instead of a raw string. The return value was also changed to provide
a more idiomatic type.

## Hacking

Patches are encouraged through GitHub pull requests. Please ensure that:

1.  A test is added for anything more than a trivial change and that the
    existing tests pass. See below for instructions on setting up your test
    environment.
2.  Please ensure that `gofmt` has been run on the changed files before
    committing. Install a pre-commit hook with the following command:

    $ ln -s ../../misc/git/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit

See [the issue tracker][issues] for features that need implementing.

### Testing Locally

Run the tests:

    $ go test

*   There is one top-level test for each of:

    1.  Chromium and ChromeDriver.
    2.  A new version of Firefox and Selenium 3.
    3.  HTMLUnit, a Java-based lightweight headless browser implementation.
    4.  A new version of Firefox directly against Geckodriver.

    There are subtests that are shared between both top-level tests.

*   To run only one of the top-level tests, pass one of:

    *   `-test.run=TestFirefoxSelenium3`,
    *   `-test.run=TestFirefoxGeckoDriver`,
    *   `-test.run=TestHTMLUnit`, or
    *   `-test.run=TestChrome`.

    To run a specific subtest, pass `-test.run=Test<Browser>/<subtest>` as
    appropriate. This flag supports regular expressions.

*   If the Chrome or Firefox binaries, the Selenium JAR, the Geckodriver binary,
    or the ChromeDriver binary cannot be found, the corresponding tests will be
    skipped.

*   The binaries and JAR under test can be configured by passing flags to `go
    test`. See the available flags with `go test --arg --help`.

*   Add the argument `-test.v` to see detailed output from the test automation
    framework.

### Testing With Docker

To ensure hermeticity, we also have tests that run under Docker. You will need
an installed and running Docker system.

To run the tests under Docker, run:

    $ go test --docker

This will create a new Docker container and run the tests in it. (Note: flags
supplied to this invocation are not curried through to the `go test` invocation
within the Docker container).

For debugging Docker directly, run the following commands:

    $ docker build -t go-selenium testing/
    $ docker run --volume=${GOPATH?}:/code --workdir=/code/src/github.com/tebeka/selenium -it go-selenium bash

### Testing With Sauce Labs

Tests can be run using a browser located in the cloud via Sauce Labs.

To run the tests under Sauce, run:

    $ go test --test.run=TestSauce --test.timeout=20m \
      --experimental_enable_sauce \
      --sauce_user_name=[username goes here] \
      --sauce_access_key=[access key goes here]

The Sauce access key can be obtained via
[the Sauce Labs user settings page](https://saucelabs.com/beta/user-settings).

Test results can be viewed through the
[Sauce Labs Dashboard](https://saucelabs.com/beta/dashboard/tests).
