There's no active development other than accepting patches currently.

# About
This is a [Selenium][selenium] client for [Go][go].
Currently it supports only the remote WebDriver client, so you'll need a
[selenium server][server] running.

## AppEngine

`GetHTTPClient` exposes the HTTP client used by the driver. You can access it to
add the request context.

    func myRequestHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        selenium.GetHTTPClient().Transport = &urlfetch.Transport{
            Context:  appengine.NewContext(r),
            Deadline: 30 * time.Second,
        }
        ...
    }

Thanks to [bthomson](https://bitbucket.org/tebeka/selenium/issue/8) for this
one.

# Hacking

* You'll need a Selenium server to run the tests, run `selenium.sh download` to
  get it and `selenium.sh start` to run it.
* Test with `./run-tests.sh`.
    * Alternatively if you have docker run `make test-docker` which will run the
      tests in a docker container without all these annoying windows popping up.
* I (Miki) work on `dev` branch since `go get` pull from default.
